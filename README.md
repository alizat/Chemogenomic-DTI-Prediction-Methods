# Chemogenomic-DTI-Prediction-Methods


## About this repository
This repository has been initially established to hold the source code used for conducting the experiments explained in the following paper:

**Computational Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions using Chemogenomic Approaches: An Empirical Survey**  
*Ali Ezzat, Min Wu, Xiao-Li Li, and Chee-Keong Kwoh*


## About the source code
The source code is entirely written in the MATLAB programming language. Over the next few months, it is our intention to regularly add source codes for more DTI prediction algorithms, especially those that were not released in their respective papers. Stay tuned!
